This is forked from [Adafruit's bootloader](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Trinket-Gemma-Bootloader).


Adafruit-Trinket-Gemma-Bootloader
=================================

This is the code for the Trinket/Gemma bootloader. There are two versions, HV (16MHz 5V) and LV (8MHz 3V), but we only use the 3V version and then clock double in the user code.

Check the Makefile for fuses, etc. Requires modifications to avrdude.conf - for advanced users only - we do not offer any support for this code!

=================================
 Please note: you cannot use the Adafruit USB VID/PID for your own non-Trinket/Gemma products or projects. Purchase a USB VID for yourself at http://www.usb.org/developers/vendor/
